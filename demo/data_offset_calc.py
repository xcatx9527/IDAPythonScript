# data_offset_calc.py
# Resolves the references to indirect offsets of a variable, register, or memory location
# whose value is known. Changes the display of the operand in the instruction (OpAlt function),
# creates a data cross references (add_dref), and creates a comment of the resolved address
# (MakeComment). User nees to define the following:
# 			offset_var_string: The string representation of the variable, register, or memory
#								location to be replaced by the resolved value
#			offset_var_value:	The value of the variable defined in offset_var_string
#			reg_ex_indirect:	A regular expression of how indirect offset accesses to the variable
#			reg_ex_immediate:	A regular expression of how the immediate offset value is represented
#			new_opnd_display:	A string representation of how the calculated and resolved 
#								value should be displayed as the operand in the instruction
#
# Inputs: 	start_addr: 	Start address for segment to define as data
#			end_addr:		End address for segment to define as data
