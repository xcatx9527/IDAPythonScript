# identify_operand_locations.py
# Identifies the instructions in the range start_addr to end_addr that reference the 
# input operand (regex_operand). The addresses of all instructions where the operand is 
# found are printed to the IDA output window and saved to a file.
#
# User-Defined Input: 	
# ** Before use, edit the regex_operand regular expression to match how the operand of interest
# is displayed in instructions.
# ** If you do not want to search the entire database, change start_addr and end_addr.
