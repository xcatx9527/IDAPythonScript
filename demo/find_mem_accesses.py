# find_mem_accesses.py
# 
# Identifies the memory accesses used in the code. When a memory access is identified based
# on the user contributed regular expression, this script completes three different actions
# to help with the static analysis:
# 	1. 	A cross reference is created between the instruction and the memory address. This 
#		will fail if the address doesn't currently exist because the segment was not created.
# 	2. 	The value at the memory address is retrieved and added as a comment to the 
#		referencing instruction.
#	3. 	A dictionary of all of the memory addresses accessed and the referencing instructions'
#		addresses are printed and saved to a file.
# ** NOTE:If you are using a Harvard architecture, ensure you can distinguish between memory
# spaces or comment out the cross-reference and value parts of this script.
#
# Inputs: 	start_addr: 	Start address for segment to define as data
#			end_addr:		End address for segment to define as data
#			file_name:		File to write the accesses to
