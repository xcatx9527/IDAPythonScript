# make_strings.py
# Searches the user entered address range for a series of ASCII bytes to define as strings.
# If the continuous series of ASCII bytes has a length greater or equal to minimum_length and
# ends with a character in string_end, the scripts undefines the bytes in the series
# and attempts to define it as a string.
#
# Input: 	start_addr: 	Start address for range to search for strings
#			end_addr:		End address for range to search for strings
