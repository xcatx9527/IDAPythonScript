# label_funcs_with_no_xrefs.py
# This script checks each defined function in the address range entered for cross-references. 
# If there are no cross-references to the function, the prefix "noXrefs_" is added to the 
# function's name. It then iterates through all functions in the code range again to identify
# all functions who's only code references are functions that have no cross-references. This
# is to detected functions called only by other functions who have no code references.
# This script helps to detect "dead code" that is never called.
#
# Inputs: 	start_addr: 	Start address for segment to define as data
#			end_addr:		End address for segment to define as data
#           ignore_addrs:   Addresses of functions that should not be considered as "noXref"
#                           For Example, RESET should be listed here
