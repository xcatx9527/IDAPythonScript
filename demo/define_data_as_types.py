# define_data_as_types.py
# Defines a segment of addresses as the user-specified data type (byte, word, or double word).
# The byte length for each of these types is architecture dependent, but generally:
#		1 byte  = Byte
#       2 bytes = Word
#		4 bytes = Double Word
# This script with undefine all bytes in the range first which means if you previously had
# code or strings defined in the area, they will be overwritten as data.
#
# Inputs: 	start_addr: 	Start address for segment to define as data
#			end_addr:		End address for segment to define as data
#			data_type:		Type of data to set segment to (dependent on architecture)
